  HANDSHAKE
</a>


I am a current first-year at Dartmouth College with a profound interest in information technology and cybersecurity. I plan on majoring in Computer Science. 

## Objective

My goal is to gain a diverse Computer Science education and expand my skillset by learning software development/engineering, 3D Modeling, Networking, cybersecurity, and more. I am working towards eventually joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst and gaining hands-on experience as a cybersecurity professional. I'll accomplish this by starting with IT to gain the necessary fundamental knowledge/experience to succeed in cybersecurity and acquiring an internship.
